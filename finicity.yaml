      summary: Create Access Token
      description: >-
        Send Partner ID and Partner Secret to the Partner Authentication service
        to obtain a token for accessing Finicity APIs.

        * The token is valid for two hours and is required on all calls to the
        Finicity APIs

        * As a best practice, use a single token for all calls. Assign a
        timestamp for each token, and then check the current timestamp before
        making any calls. If the token is greater than 90 minutes, generate a
        new one.

        * ⚠️ After five failed attempts to authenticate, your account will be
        locked. Contact [support@finicity.com](mailto:support@finicity.com) to
        get help resetting your account.

        Client apps are not permitted to automate calls to the Refresh services.
        Active accounts are automatically refreshed by Finicity once per day.
        Because many financial institutions only post transactions once per day,
        calling Refresh repeatedly is usually a waste of resources and is not
        recommended.


        Apps may call Refresh services for a specific customer when there is a
        specific business case for the need of data that is up to date as of the
        moment. Please discuss with your account manager and systems engineer
        for further clarification.


        The recommended timeout setting for this request is 120 seconds in order
        to receive a response. However, you can terminate the connection after
        making the call the operation will still complete. You will have to pull
        the account records to check for an updated aggregation attempt date to
        know when the refresh is complete.

      summary: Load Historic Transactions for Customer Account
      description: >-
        Connect to the account's financial institution and load up to 24 months
        of historic transactions for the account. Length of history varies by
        institution.


        This is a premium service. The billable event is a call to this service
        specifying a customer ID that has not been seen before by this service.
        (If this service is called multiple times with the same customer ID, to
        load transactions from multiple accounts, only one billable event has
        occurred.)


        The recommended timeout setting for this request is 180 seconds in order
        to receive a response. However, you can terminate the connection after
        making the call the operation will still complete. You will have to pull
        the account records to check for an updated aggregation attempt date to
        know when the refresh is complete.


        The date range sent to the institution is calculated from the account's
        `createdDate`. This means that calling this service a second time for
        the same account normally will not add any new transactions for the
        account. For this reason, a second call to this service for a known
        account ID will usually return immediately.


        In a few specific scenarios, it may be desirable to force a second
        connection to the institution for a known account ID. Some examples are:


        * The institution's policy has changed, making more transactions
        available

        * Finicity has now added a longer transaction history support for the
        institution

        * The first call encountered an error, and the resulting Aggregation
        Ticket has now been fixed by the Finicity Support Team


        In these cases, the POST request can contain the parameter `force=true`
        in the request body to force the second connection.

        Each call to this service will return two records, one with class
        account and one with class transaction. Account events are sent when
        values change in the account's fields (such as `balance` or
        `interestRate`). Transaction events are sent whenever a new transaction
        is posted for the account. For institutions that do not provide TxPush
        services, notifications are sent as soon as Finicity finds a new
        transaction or new account data through regular aggregation processes.


        The listener's URL must be secure (HTTPS) for any real-world account. In
        addition, the client's TxPush Listener will need to be verified. HTTP
        and HTTPS connections are only allowed on the standard ports 80 (HTTP)
        and 443 (HTTPS). The use of other ports will result with the call
        failing.

        This allows an app to trigger TxPush notifications for the account in

        This report is provided under FCRA rules, with Finicity acting as the
        CRA (Consumer Reporting Agency). If an individual account is included in
        the report - for example, with an individual acting as an personal
        guarantor on the loan - then this version of the report should be used.
        In case of an adverse action on the loan where the decision was based on
        this report, then the borrower can be referred to the [Finicity Consumer
        Portal](https://consumer.finicityreports.com) where they can view this
        report and submit a dispute if they feel any information in this report
        is inaccurate.


        Before calling this API, a consumer must be created for the given
        customer ID (see Consumers APIs).


        If no account type of checking or savings is found, the service will
        return HTTP 400 Bad Request.

        The `reportCustomFields` parameter is used when experiences are
        associated with a credit decisioning report.


        Designate up to 5 custom fields that you'd like associated with the
        report when it's generated. Every custom field consists of three
        variables: `label`, `value`, and `shown`. The `shown` variable is "true"
        or "false".

        * "true": (default) display the custom field in the PDF report

        * "false": don't display the custom field in the PDF report


        For an experience that generates multiple reports, the
        `reportCustomFields` parameter gets passed to all reports.


        All custom fields display in the Reseller Billing API.

        credit decisioning report and any other reports with transaction data.
        The value is in epoch time and must be 10 digits. Example: 1494449017.
        If it's greater than 10 digits, then the `fromDate` is set to the credit
        decisioning report's default `fromDate`.


        For an experience that generates multiple reports, the `fromDate` gets
        passed to the reports that support it.


        However, Connect doesn't pass this parameter to the following reports:

        * Pay Statement Extraction Report 

        * VOIE - Paystub (with TXVerify) Report 

        * Statement Report 

        * Verification of Income Report 

        * VOIE - Payroll Report 


        Note: this field isn't used if you're only collecting transaction data
        without a report.
