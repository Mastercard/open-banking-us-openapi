      summary: Create Access Token
      description: >-
        Send Partner ID and Partner Secret to the Partner Authentication service
        to obtain a token for accessing Finicity APIs.

        * The token is valid for two hours and is required on all calls to the
        Finicity APIs

        * As a best practice, use a single token for all calls. Assign a
        timestamp for each token, and then check the current timestamp before
        making any calls. If the token is greater than 90 minutes, generate a
        new one.

        * ⚠️ After five failed attempts to authenticate, your account is locked.
        Contact [support@finicity.com](mailto:support@finicity.com) to get help
        resetting your account.

        Finbank testing institutions.

        Client apps are not permitted to automate calls to the "Refresh"
        services. Active accounts are automatically refreshed by Finicity once
        per day. Because many financial institutions only post transactions once
        per day, calling Refresh repeatedly is usually a waste of resources and
        is not recommended.


        Apps may call "Refresh" services for a specific customer when there is a
        specific business case for the need of data that is up to date as of the
        moment. Please discuss with your account manager and systems engineer
        for further clarification.


        The recommended timeout setting for this request is 120 seconds in order
        to receive a response. However you can terminate the connection after
        making the call the operation will still complete. You will have to pull
        the account records to check for an updated aggregation attempt date to
        know when the refresh is complete.

      description: >-

        the  given `customerId` with a connection to the institution.


        Client apps are not permitted to automate calls to the "Refresh"
        services. Active accounts are automatically refreshed by Finicity once
        per day. Because many financial institutions only post transactions once
        per day, calling Refresh repeatedly is usually a waste of resources and
        is not recommended.


        Apps may call "Refresh" services for a specific customer when there is a
        specific business case for the need of data that is up to date as of the
        moment. Please discuss with your account manager and systems engineer
        for further clarification.


        The recommended timeout setting for this request is 120 seconds in order
        to receive a response. However you can terminate the connection after
        making the call the operation will still complete. You will have to pull
        the account records to check for an updated aggregation attempt date to
        know when the refresh is complete.

      summary: Load Historic Transactions for Customer Account
      description: >-
        Connect to the account's financial institution and load up to 24 months
        of historic transactions for the account. Length of history varies by
        institution.


        This is a premium service. The billable event is a call to this service
        specifying a customer ID that has not been seen before by this service.
        (If this service is called multiple times with the same customer ID, to
        load transactions from multiple accounts, only one billable event has
        occurred.)


        The recommended timeout setting for this request is 180 seconds in order
        to receive a response. However you can terminate the connection after
        making the call the operation will still complete. You will have to pull
        the account records to check for an updated aggregation attempt date to
        know when the refresh is complete.


        The date range sent to the institution is calculated from the account's
        `createdDate`. This means that calling this service a second time for
        the same account normally will not add any new transactions for the
        account. For this reason, a second call to this service for a known
        account ID will usually return immediately.


        In a few specific scenarios, it may be desirable to force a second
        connection to the institution for a known account ID. Some examples are:


        * The institution's policy has changed, making more transactions
        available

        * Finicity has now added a longer transaction history support for the
        institution

        * The first call encountered an error, and the resulting Aggregation
        Ticket has now been fixed by the Finicity Support Team


        In these cases, the POST request can contain the parameter `force=true`
        in the request body to force the second connection.

        Generate a Verification of Assets (VOA) report for all checking,
        savings, money market, and investment accounts for the given customer.
        This service retrieves up to twelve months of transaction history for
        each account and uses this information to generate the VOA report.


        This is a premium service. The billing rate is the variable rate for
        Verification of Assets under the current subscription plan. The billable
        event is the successful generation of a VOA report.


        A report consumer must be created for the given customer before calling
        this API (see "Consumers").


        After making this call, the client app may wait for a notification to be
        sent to callback URL (a Report Listener Service), or it may enter a
        loop, which should wait 20 seconds and then call the service "Get
        Report" to see if the report is finished. While the report is being
        generated, "Get Report" will return a minimal report with the following
        status: `inProgress`. The loop should repeat every 20 seconds until "Get
        Report" returns a different status.


        If no account of type of checking, savings, money market, or investment
        is found, the service will return HTTP 400 Bad Request.

        Generate a Statement Report report for specified accounts under the

        This is a premium service. A billable event will be created upon the
        successful generation of the Statement Report. 


        After making this call, the client app may wait for a notification to be
        sent to callback URL (a Report Listener Service), or it may enter a
        loop, which should wait 20 seconds and then call the service "Get
        Report" to see if the report is finished. While the report is being
        generated, "Get Report" will return a minimal report with the following
        status: `inProgress`. The loop should repeat every 20 seconds until "Get
        Report" returns a different status.


        A Report Consumer must be created for the given Customer (using Create
        Report Consumer) before calling this service. If no Report Consumer has
        been created, the service will return HTTP 400 Bad Request.

        It retrieves the latest credit transaction information from the

        so that you can view their payment history to ensure a direct deport was

        isn't necessary.

            beyond 10 digits or beyond 120 days from the present date will
            default back to 120 days of data. This query is optional.

        Used to generate a Consumer Attributes report for a customer. The `To`
        and `From` date range is the last 12 months of consumer data, based on
        the `created_date` when the report was generated.


        An `analityic_id` value is also created and associated with a customer's
        ID. If you generate multiple Consumer Attributes reports for the same
        `customerId`, a new `analityic_id` and `created_date` are created for
        each instance.


        To view a list of all the `analytic_ids` for a customer, use the List
        Consumer Attributes API.

        The list displays all the `analytic_ids` and `created_date` (Epoch time)

        Used to retrieve a Consumer Attributes (CA) report for a customer. The
        `analytic_id` and the `created_date` are generated from the [Generate
        Consumer Attributes API-Beta]
        (https://api-reference.finicity.com/#/rest/api-endpoints/analytics/generate-consumer-attributes-beta).


        Use the `analytic_id` and `customerId` to retrieve 12 months of data
        attributes according to the `To` and `From` date range of the report at
        the time it was created. 


        If the current date is before the end of the calendar month, then the
        most recent month provides all available data up to the current date.


        The CA data response is grouped into the following attribute objects: 

        * `accountIds` 

        * `dateRange` 

        * `income` 

        * `expenses` 

        * `netAmount`

        * MVS modules: financial, payroll, paystub


        Note: the Finicity sales engineers (SE) help you set up a default
        experience for your company when you migrate to Connect 2.0. For each
        additional experience you create thereafter, they'll give you a unique
        ID. See [Generate 2.0 Connect URL
        APIs](https://docs.finicity.com/migrate-to-connect-web-sdk-2-0/#migrate-connect-web-sdk-1).
                    

        Experience values options: 

        * "default": your default experience (must be defined) 

        * GUID: the code for a different experience

        * Not defined: If you don't pass the experience parameter, then

      description: >-
        The `reportCustomFields` parameter is used when experiences are
        associated with a credit decisioning report.


        Designate up to 5 custom fields that you'd like associated with the
        report when it's generated. Every custom field consists of three
        variables: `label`, `value`, and `shown`. The `shown` variable is true
        or false. 

        * `true`: (default) display the custom field in the PDF report

        * `false`: don't display the custom field in the PDF report


        For an experience that generates multiple reports, the
        `reportCustomFields` parameter gets passed to all reports.


        All custom fields display in the Reseller Billing endpoint.
    ConnectFromDate:
      type: integer
      description: >-
        The `fromDate` parameter is used when experiences are associated with a
        credit decisioning report and any other reports with transaction data.
        The value is in epoch time and must be 10 digits. Example: 1494449017.
        If it's greater than 10 digits, then the `fromDate` is set to the credit
        decisioning report's default `fromDate`.


        For an experience that generates multiple reports, the `fromDate` gets
        passed to the reports that support it.


        However, Connect doesn't pass this parameter to the following reports:

        * Pay Statement Extraction Report 

        * VOIE - Paystub (with TXVerify) Report 

        * Statement Report 

        * Verification of Income Report 

        * VOIE - Payroll Report 


        Note: this field isn't used if you're only collecting transaction data
        without a report.
