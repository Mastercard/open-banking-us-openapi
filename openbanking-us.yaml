      summary: Create Access Token
      description: >-
        Send Partner ID and Partner Secret to the Partner Authentication service
        to obtain a token for accessing Finicity APIs.

        * The token is valid for two hours and is required on all calls to the
        Finicity APIs

        * As a best practice, use a single token for all calls. Assign a
        timestamp for each token, and then check the current timestamp before
        making any calls. If the token is greater than 90 minutes, generate a
        new one.

        * ⚠️ After five failed attempts to authenticate, your account will be
        locked. To reset your account, you can report a support issue using the
        support.finicity.com portal. Alternatively, contact your Client Success
        Manager or your onboarding representative.

        The Connect Web SDK isn't a requirement when using Connect lite.
        However, if you want to use the SDK events, routes, and user events,
        then you must integrate with the Connect Web SDK.

      summary: Load Historic Transactions for Customer Account
      description: >-
        Connect to the account's financial institution and load up to 24 months
        of historic transactions for the account. Length of history varies by
        institution.


        This is a premium service. The billable event is a call to this service
        specifying a customer ID that has not been seen before by this service.
        (If this service is called multiple times with the same customer ID, to
        load transactions from multiple accounts, only one billable event has
        occurred.)


        The recommended timeout setting for this request is 180 seconds in order
        to receive a response. However, you can terminate the connection after
        making the call the operation will still complete. You will have to pull
        the account records to check for an updated aggregation attempt date to
        know when the refresh is complete.


        The date range sent to the institution is calculated from the account's
        `createdDate`. This means that calling this service a second time for
        the same account normally will not add any new transactions for the
        account. For this reason, a second call to this service for a known
        account ID will usually return immediately.


        In a few specific scenarios, it may be desirable to force a second
        connection to the institution for a known account ID. Some examples are:


        * The institution's policy has changed, making more transactions
        available

        * Finicity has now added a longer transaction history support for the
        institution

        * The first call encountered an error, and the resulting Aggregation
        Ticket has now been fixed by the Finicity Support Team


        In these cases, the POST request can contain the parameter `force=true`
        in the request body to force the second connection.

        Payment Success Indicator (PSI) is a Payment Intelligence solution that
        uses Financial Institution (FI) data to help payment originators
        evaluate a consumer's ability to pay now and in the future within a
        given time period. PSI is for payment originators to assess a consumer's
        real-time FI account balance and historical FI account activities to
        help minimize ACH declines and enable payment originators to gracefully
        transition to alternative payment methods or schedules when payment
        settlement using ACH / Account-based payment is less likely. PSI may not
        be used for credit or insurance underwriting, employment or rental
        screening, or any other purpose(s) that would implicate the Fair Credit
        Reporting Act or other consumer reporting law.

      summary: Get Customer Account Transactions
      description: >-
        Get all transactions available for this customer account within the
        given date range. This service supports paging and sorting by
        `transactionDate` (or `postedDate` if no transaction date is provided),
        with a maximum of 1000 transactions per request.


        Standard consumer aggregation provides up to 180 days of transactions
        prior to the date each account was added to the Finicity system. To
        access older transactions, you must first call the Cash Flow
        Verification service Load Historic Transactions for Account.


        There is no limit for the size of the window between `fromDate` and
        `toDate`, however, the maximum number of transactions returned on one
        page is 1000.

        Each call to this service will return two records, one with class
        account and one with class transaction. Account events are sent when
        values change in the account's fields (such as `balance` or
        `interestRate`). Transaction events are sent whenever a new transaction
        is posted for the account. For institutions that do not provide TxPush
        services, notifications are sent as soon as Finicity finds a new
        transaction or new account data through regular aggregation processes.


        The listener's URL must be secure (HTTPS) for any real-world account. In
        addition, the client's TxPush Listener will need to be verified. HTTP
        and HTTPS connections are only allowed on the standard ports 80 (HTTP)
        and 443 (HTTPS). The use of other ports will result with the call
        failing.

        in the response are obtained from the customer's financial institution
        and will be accompanied by a matching score for any value(s) provided in
        the request. These scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher number
        signifying an increased confidence that the two values are matching.

      description: >-
        The `fromDate` parameter is used when experiences are associated with a
        credit decisioning report and any other reports with transaction data.
        The value is in epoch time and must be 10 digits. Example: 1494449017.
        If it's greater than 10 digits, then the `fromDate` is set to the credit
        decisioning report's default `fromDate`.


        For an experience that generates multiple reports, the `fromDate` gets
        passed to the reports that support it.


        However, Connect doesn't pass this parameter to the following reports:

        * Pay Statement Extraction Report

        * VOIE - Paystub (with TXVerify) Report

        * Statement Report

        * Verification of Income Report

        * VOIE - Payroll Report


        Note: this field isn't used if you're only collecting transaction data
        without a report.

            During the insight evaluation, risk signals are generated when a request triggers either the rules or machine learning model. Each risk signal and it's associated definition is shown below.
              * `account_carrier_unknown` - Carrier information for account is
            unknown

        The calculated device risk is represented numerically using a range from 1 (no/low risk) to 5 (high risk). Each numerical value and it's associated risk representation is shown below.
          * `1` - Represents a no or low risk request.
          * `2` - Represents a low risk request.
          * `3` - Represents a medium risk request.
          * `4` - Represents a high risk request.
          * `5` - Represents a very high risk request.

        The calculated risk score is typically used to identify scenarios where a service provider may want to introduce consumer friction on the authorization process to validate the identity of the consumer. Example usage by a service provider may be to implement controls such as multifactor authentication for calculated risk factors of `3` or `4` and request blocking for risk factors of `5`.
